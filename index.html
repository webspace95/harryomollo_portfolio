								I have a background in Mathematics and Computer 
								science from University but when it comes to 
								programming, I'm mostly self-taught. I specialize 
								in Web development, <span class="skill">Python</span> and <span class="skill">Django</span> for the Back-end and
								<span class="skill">HTML/CSS</span>, <span class="skill">Bootstrap</span>, <span class="skill">React.js</span>, and <span class="skill">JavaScript</span> for the Front-end. 
								I’m also familiar with Blockchain development.
								 I can build and deploy Smart contracts 
								 and web3 dApps with <span class="skill">Solidity</span>, <span class="skill">Web3.py</span>, 
								 and <span class="skill">Brownie</span>. I currently have a keen interest 
								 in Web3 and Blockchain technology and all the 
								 technologies under this umbrella-like NFTs, Defi, 
								 Metaverse, and Smart contracts. I’m fascinated with how
								  Blockchain and Web3 could disrupt many industries and the technology in the space that excites me the most is 
								the concept of Hybrid-Smart contracts.

								<h2>About me</h2>
							</header>
							<p>I was born and raised in Kenya. As a kid, I wasn't really into computers but I was really curious and I read a lot and watched lots of documentaries. If you gave me a choice between watching a 2hr movie and watching a 10hr documentary about string theory, dark matter, and dark energy, I would always choose the latter. I didn't get into coding and computer science until I was 15. </p>
							<p>My first programming language was C++. I must say it was really hard! But it put me on the map and I got to understand the basic fundamentals of it. I later learned C# and Unity and started building video games. At this point, I was sure about my career path and the person I wanted to become in the future. Because getting game development jobs was hard, I decided to learn JavaScript and start Web development. At this point, I had finished High school and was ready to join University. </p>
							<p>The main reason I got into tech was that I wanted to learn how video games were made. Learning the necessary skills was the easy part. Getting into the industry from my country was the hard part because virtually no one was doing it. I developed an Interest in Artificial intelligence but I decided to learn Web development first because it was easier to get freelancing gigs in Web dev.  </p>
							<p>I’m currently into AI and Blockchain Technology but I still build web apps using Python Django and React on the side. My long-term goal is to become a Tech entrepreneur. I'm seeing that happening in the world of Blockchain or AI. I want to help build a future powered by Blockchain and AI, and also help solve some of the world’s problems with these technologies. </p>
							<p>Aside from computers, I love reading, watching documentaries, Music, Chess, and Watching Series (Crime and Thriller mostly) my favorite being The Blacklist.</p>
							<p>✨Great things happen when Creativity meets imagination ✨</p>
