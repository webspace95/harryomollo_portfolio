							<p>
								I have a background in Mathematics and Computer science from Uni but when it comes to programming,
								I'm mostly self-tought. I specialize in python, Machine learning and Blockchain development.
								In python, I work with tools like Django, Tensorflow and Web3.py to build web apps, Machine Learning & Data apps and Web3 blockchain Dapps.
								I currently have a keen interest in Web3 and Blockchain technology and and all the technologies under this umbrella like NFTs, DeFi, Metaverse, Smart contracts 
								and etc. Im a big follower of the "Decentralized web" movement and my current goal is to figure out different ways in which Machine learning can be applied in the Blockchain, 
								and take part in accelerating the movement that way.

								<h2>About me</h2>
							</header>
							<p>I was born and raised in Kenya. As a kid I wasn't really into computers but I was really curious and I read alot of books and loved watching documentaries. if you gave me a choice between watching a 2hr movie or watching a 10hr documentary about astrophysics or finding life on Mars or the Dark ages, I would always choose the latter. I didn't get into coding and computer science until I was 15. </p>
							<p>My first programming language was C++. I must say it was really hard! but it put me on the map and I got to understand the basic fundamentals from it. I later learned C# and Unity and started building video games. At this point, I was sure about my career path and the person I wanted to become in future. Because getting game development jobs was hard, I decided to learn Javascript and start Web development. At this point I had finished Highschool and ready to join Uni. </p>
							<p>The main reason I got into tech was because I wanted to learn how video games were made. Learning the necesary skills was the easy part. Getting in the industry from my country was the hard part because virtually no one was doing it and this made me "pivot". I developed an Interest in Artificial intelligence but I decided to learn Web development first because it was easier to get freelancing gigs in Web dev.  </p>
							<p>Im currently into AI and Blockchain Technology but I still build web apps and modile apps using Python Django and React Native on the side. My long-term goal is to become a Tech enterpreneur. I'm seeing that happening in the world of Blockchain and AI. I want to help build a future powered by Blockchain and AI, and also help solve some of the world problems with this technologies. </p>
							<p>Aside from computers, I love reading books, watching documentaries, Music, Chess and Watching Series(Crime Investigation mostly) my favorite being The Blacklist.</p>
							<p>Great things happen when Creativity meets imagination</p>
